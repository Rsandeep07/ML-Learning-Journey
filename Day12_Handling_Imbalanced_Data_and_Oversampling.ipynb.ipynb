    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Outlier Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outliers** are data points that significantly deviate from the majority of data points.  \n",
    "They may arise due to:\n",
    "- Noise or measurement errors\n",
    "- Rare events\n",
    "- Data generation issues\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Why detect outliers?\n",
    "- Outliers can influence the model heavily\n",
    "- They distort regression planes / decision boundaries\n",
    "- They may reduce model performance\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️ Hence, detect and handle outliers during preprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚙️ Popular Outlier Detection Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Libraries:\n",
    "- **pyod** → KNN and many advanced algorithms  \n",
    "- **sklearn** → IsolationForest, LOF  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1️⃣ Isolation Forest\n",
    "\n",
    "📦 `sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Main Advantages\n",
    "- Very fast and scalable\n",
    "- No need of feature scaling\n",
    "- Works well for high dimensional data\n",
    "- Unsupervised method\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 How it works\n",
    "- Builds a large number of random trees (Extra Trees)\n",
    "- Randomly selects feature and split value\n",
    "- Outliers are isolated at early levels (shorter path length)\n",
    "- Normal points require more splits\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Anomaly Score\n",
    "- Based on average path length in trees\n",
    "- Shorter path → higher anomaly score → outlier\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Contamination parameter\n",
    "- Defines expected fraction of outliers (e.g., 0.05)\n",
    "- Top anomaly scores based on contamination are marked as outliers\n",
    "- If not given, model estimates automatically (may vary like 10%, 20%)\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️ Usually we explicitly set contamination.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2️⃣ KNN-based Outlier Detection\n",
    "\n",
    "📦 Available in **pyod**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Idea\n",
    "For each data point:\n",
    "1. Find k nearest neighbors (assume k = 5)\n",
    "2. Compute average distance:\n",
    "\n",
    "d_avg = (d_nn1 + d_nn2 + d_nn3 + d_nn4 + d_nn5) / 5\n",
    "\n",
    "- If d_avg is high → point is far → outlier\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❌ Disadvantage\n",
    "- Computationally very expensive\n",
    "- Needs distance computation for all points\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3️⃣ LOF – Local Outlier Factor\n",
    "\n",
    "📦 `sklearn.neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Idea\n",
    "- Calculates local density for each observation\n",
    "- Compares density with its neighbors\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️ If density is much lower → considered as outlier\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Strength\n",
    "- Detects local outliers inside clusters\n",
    "- Also works for global outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## ⚖️ Imbalanced Data\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 What is Imbalanced Data?\n",
    "When categories of the target variable are not equally represented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "- Class A = 95% → Majority\n",
    "- Class B = 5% → Minority\n",
    "\n",
    "➡️ This dataset is highly imbalanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Why is it important?\n",
    "\n",
    "Most ML algorithms assume:\n",
    "> All classes are represented equally.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in imbalanced data:\n",
    "- Model becomes biased towards majority class\n",
    "- Learns majority patterns more frequently\n",
    "- Performs poorly on minority class\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 Effects of Imbalanced Data\n",
    "- High accuracy but poor minority class recall\n",
    "- Model predicts majority class most of the time\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "If 95% = A, model predicts always A → 95% accuracy but useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 When imbalance may not affect much (T&C)\n",
    "1. Dataset is sufficiently large  \n",
    "2. Data is linearly separable  \n",
    "\n",
    "⚠️ These cases are rare in practice.\n",

    "❌ **Risk:** Loss of useful information  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⚠️ Important Rule\n",
    "✔️ Apply oversampling/undersampling **only on training data**  \n",
